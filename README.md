-powerpoint-rename: Written for a class where the .pptx files had spaces in the names and embeded video tracks in them. The audio was really slow and pausing ans play capabilities for pptx on linux is not great. So this simple script removes spaces in the file names and changes the file extention to .zip. Once a zip, the audio can be accessed and played on the user's choice of mp3 player.
